# This is flusi's runtime control file
# You can influence a running simulation with this file
# flusi regularily reads it and checks what to do
# 
# 
# The following is currently available:
# 
# ----------------------------------
# Re-read PARAMS.ini file from disk
# ----------------------------------
# This is useful to correct some parameters. 
# Be careful: the entire file is reloaded. Some parameters
# can easily be changed, for example the penalization param
# eps or saving flags.
# Others cause an immediate crash (eg changing nx,ny,nz)
# runtime_control=reload_params;
# 
# ----------------------------------
# Safe stop (dump backup then stop)
# ----------------------------------
# Stop the run but makes a backup first
# Memory is properly dealloacted, unlike KILL
# runtime_control=save_stop;
