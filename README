Notes for FLUSI (with HDF5)

on sugiton, I've had to install hdf5_mpich2 and hdf5_mpich2_devel, then I was able to link the FLUSI with LDFLAGS=... -lhdf5_fortran -lhdf5 -lz
there was then no need to specify where HDF5 lives (-I/../../ and -L/../..)
environment:
export HDF_ROOT=””
export FFT_ROOT="/home/tommy/fftw"
export P3DFFT_ROOT="/home/tommy/Documents/Research/src/p3dfft.2.3.2_fixed"
export FFLAGS="-g"


on the mesocentre
I had to recompile FFTW and P3DFFT first, because they were using openmpi, which seems not to work with HDF.
So now modules:
module load intel/12.1 mpich2/intel/1.4.1
export P3DFFT_ROOT="/home/ethomas/p3dfft.2.3.2_fixed"
export FFT_ROOT="/home/ethomas/fftw"
export FFLAGS=""
export HDF_ROOT=”/LOGINSTO/softs/hdf5/intel/1.8.8/”
the modifications on the mesocentre are reflected in the makefile.



notes from the makefile:
# note that FFT_ROOT, P3DFFT_ROOT, and FFLAGS must be set in the shell
# (e.g. in .bashrc).
